# Machine Learning with PyTorch

This project demonstrates a machine learning workflow using **PyTorch** and supporting libraries.  
It covers dataset loading, preprocessing, model implementation, training, and visualization of results.

## üìå Features
- Data handling with **NumPy**, **SciPy**, and **scikit-learn**
- Model implementation using **PyTorch** (`torch` and `torch.nn`)
- Visualizations with **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn**
- End-to-end workflow inside a Jupyter Notebook

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

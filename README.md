# Solving-Differential-Equations-Using-PINNs
My Project Under Paac IITR

This project demonstrates a machine learning workflow using **PyTorch** and supporting libraries.  
It covers dataset loading, preprocessing, model implementation, training, and visualization of results.

## 📌 Features
- Data handling with **NumPy**, **SciPy**, and **scikit-learn**
- Model implementation using **PyTorch** (`torch` and `torch.nn`)
- Visualizations with **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn**
- End-to-end workflow inside a Jupyter Notebook

## 🛠️ Installation
Clone the repository and install dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/<repo-name>.git
cd <repo-name>
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 🚀 Usage
1. Open the notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Krish_Bansal_23115069.ipynb
   ```
2. Run all cells to reproduce the results.
3. Modify the notebook as needed for your own datasets or experiments.

## 📊 Results
The notebook demonstrates:
- Data preprocessing and analysis
- Training and evaluation of ML models
- Visualization of performance metrics and trends
